What pages should my website have? This is a very common question online
entrepreneurs and small business owners ask when they are looking to develop a
website. Here we list the most important and must-have pages your small
business company website should have. ￼ When it comes to content creation for a
newly created website, every business is unique and needs something different
However visitors to your website (your potential customers) have set
expectations of your website, what information they expect to find on it and
where on your website they expect to find it. To help you determine what
content pages to produce, here are questions you need to ask yourself, or ask
the person who will be writing the content for you, a copywriter for example:

- What pages do I need on my website?
- What should I put on the homepage?
- Do I need a privacy policy page?
- Should I have a testimonials page?
- Do I really need a company blog?
- On the “about” page, should I talk about myself or the company?

When it comes to creating pages for your website there is a set of web pages
that are standard or general which all small business websites should have.
Here below is a list of the 13 most common pages that every website should
have, and the type of information these pages should feature and include. If
you need to create a website, we guide you step-by-step through the process of
creating a small business website using WordPress.

everyone who you are and what your company does. The content on your homepage
should be intriguing enough to capture the attention of your visitors within
seconds. Your homepage needs to be well-designed, load fast and look
professional. There are studies that show that you have 0.05 seconds to
convince people stay on your website.

services and products, and perhaps some bullet points on how you can help your

the most visited page on any website. This page should give a brief summary of
who you are, your company history and what isolates you from the competition.

the staff, or just yourself if you are a sole proprietor), any special

Here you can list **details about the services you provide**. Begin the page with a

as well as adding a link to a landing page, where readers can learn more about
a particular service.

product pages that contain more information, what the customer can expect by

asked**The frequently asked questions (FAQ) page will tell everyone – on one

answers should be a call to action, and persuade a potential customer to take
the next step and buy whatever you’re selling.

8 - BLOG
========

This isn’t a page per say, as a blog is the sum of all blog posts. **A blog is aD
website, or a section of a website, made up of topically related blog posts
(like journal entries)**. Blog posts are usually listed in reverse chronological
order with the most recent blog post appearing first. If you have a small
business website without a blog then you are seriously missing out! Think of
your blog as your greatest and most affordable marketing tool. A blog drives
traffic and leads/sales. A survey by HubSpot found that 57% of businesses who
blog have generated a lead from it. A blog gives your company a voice, it
creates a place where you can tell your company’s story, share your expertise
and engage with your customers.

What to include:
----------------

First and foremost you need to do a `bit of strategy work <https://www.paulteitelman.com/why-most-blogs-have-sucked-for-the-last-5-years-and-what-to-do-about-it/>`_,
you need to know why you are starting a blog and who you are blogging for (your
target audience). Next you need to map out what your blog should be about, i.e.
what your should write about and the topics to cover. Think of how you write
and the language you use, most of us don’t like to read academic journals so
don’t be afraid to be conversational and casual in the way you write. Quality
trumps quantity. Studies suggest that long-form and in-depth blog posts
outperform shorter shallow blog posts, when it comes to search engine
optimization and getting shared on social media.

Sitemaps come in two formats. XML sitemaps (these are made for search engine
bots, helps search engines discover your content and is good to have from an
SEO standpoint). HTML sitemaps are made for your “human” visitors (and what we
refer to here.) A sitemap page is a non-fancy index page that lists all the web
pages you have on your website. For example check out our sitemap page on
https://digital.com/sitemap/.

What to include:
----------------

Your sitemap page should include links to all of your web page, your pages and
blog posts. Your sitemap page should be located in the footer throughout all of
your website pages, where possible. If you use WordPress then there are plenty
of plugins that can help you build an HTML sitemap.

13 - PAGE NOT FOUND PAGE
========================

A page not found page (technically speaking it’s called a “404 error” page) is
a page your visitors get directed to when a webpage no longer exists, have
moved or has expired. For example check out our custom created “page not found”
on https://digital.com/404 Because a 404 error page can be a standard HTML
page, you can (and should) customize it any way you want.

What to include:
----------------

Tell visitors clearly that the page they’re looking for cannot be found. Your
page not found page should include a link back to your homepage, you could also
include a search form.

pages do you think everyone small business website owner should include on

form your business. Most small businesses set up as an LLC (Limited Liability
Company).

liability, while giving the pass-through tax benefits of being a sole
proprietor.

The process of forming your company can be really simple. Incfile can handle
everything for you for $0 - all you pay is any state fees. Form your company
