Jigs, grips and fixtures are used in manufacturing to ensure that
component parts can be produced accurately over many cycles or
iterations. The jig supports and holds a workpiece in place, while
guiding a machining or cutting tool as it carries out a specific task.
The fixtures and grips provide additional support and precise location
for each part.

Jigs and fixtures are typically made from steel or aluminium, but the
introduction of 3D printing, or more accurately, additive manufacturing,
means a greater range of materials can be used. This process has been
adopted most prominently in the automotive, defence, aerospace and rail
industries. In this guide, we're going to outline eight reasons why you
should use 3D printing for jigs and fixtures, including increases in
speed and performance, and reductions in time and expenditure.

3D Printed Fixture 1. Cost Reduction Time is money, and the reduction in
time taken to produce parts by additive manufacturing rather than
machining automatically saves you money. In addition, instead of
outsourcing the machining of specialised jigs and fixtures, they can be
printed in house. This saves both time and money paid to third-party
suppliers.

With additive manufacturing, a 3D model is designed on a computer and
sent electronically to your 3D printer. There, it's immediately analysed
and printed automatically, requiring very little time or labour. Jigs
and fixtures made in this way also use much cheaper materials, such as
thermoplastics.

2. No Machining
===============

3D printed jigs and fixtures can be produced very
quickly, because of the way they’re designed and the materials used
in additive manufacturing. To have such parts CNC machined frequently
involves sending them out to a specialist in complex metal
geometries. You need highly skilled CAM designers and a significant
amount of planning, which extends lead times into days, and sometimes
weeks. Additive manufacturing and design can largely be done in
house, cutting lead times down to a day or less.

3. Customisation
================

Another reason why you should use 3D printing for
jigs and fixtures is that you can design them to fit your own
particular needs and circumstances. You can deploy much more
complex geometries, and produce tools that would not be possible
using traditional machining methods. You can also make your parts
in a range of colours and surface finishes. Your engineers no
longer need to design a tool purely for its manufacturability;
they now have the ability to tailor the tool for the task or the
operator.

3D printing takes advantage of a wide range of technologies and
materials, and you can build in special properties such as heat
and chemical resistance, UV stability and flame retardancy. This
enables the design of strong, lightweight tools with
high-performance materials, for complex and precise operations
such as medical surgery.

Most of the materials used for additive manufacturing are lighter
than aluminium, and are not printed as a solid but rather as a
shell that is completed with infill. This further reduces the
overall weight of parts, and consequently helps to increase
productivity. Tools are less cumbersome and easier to move around
the production floor. Materials like thermoplastics, rubber and
wax can also be combined in 3D printing to create new materials
with significantly greater mechanical properties. These can then
be used to make stronger, lighter tooling parts.

4. Component Consolidation
==========================

One of the most compelling reasons why
you should use 3D printing is the freedom of design that
additive manufacturing allows. Tools can be much more complex,
but you can also reduce or even eliminate altogether the long
lead times, labour and costs that are required for assembly
operations. Instead of multiple components being engineered for
a tool requiring assembly and fitting, the whole thing can be
redesigned as a single contiguous component. This will improve
the overall precision and accuracy of the finished tool, while
allowing no opportunity for failure of contributory parts.

5. Faster Iterations
====================

Since 3D printing is based on 3D CAD
models and a digital manufacturing process, you can do as
many iterations as you like in a much faster time. Once
you're satisfied with the CAD model, all you have to do is
upload it to your 3D printer, and you could potentially get
your part printed in a few hours. It takes so little time
that, if you don't like the design or it has a flaw, you can
keep optimising it through as many iterations as it needs to
get it right.

The rapidity of these processes means that your designers
have a great deal more freedom and time to optimise their
design before it goes into full production. This may have a
substantial impact on your ability to deliver product to
your customers speedily on demand, thus improving your
company standing.

6. Complex Design
=================

3D printing makes it much simpler for you
to come up with new and improved designs that will help
your jigs and fixtures to deliver a better performance.
To do this with tools produced by traditional methods
would be a colossal task, requiring much more effort and
expense to create new jigs and fixtures. With 3D
printing, you can create new designs at regular
intervals, optimised for performance and delivered with
greater speed and less cost.

As your tool production will no longer be limited by
machining or injection moulding operations, you have a
much larger scope with 3D printing for tool
configuration. This means you no longer have to worry
about conventional design considerations, such as
irregular contours or profiles, or the number of setups
that will be required for your parts.

7. Digital Inventory
====================

In a manufacturing context, digital
inventory refers to a computerised file management
system that provides you with virtual storage for your
3D designs. Storing parts virtually means that you can
reduce your warehouse space, as you'll no longer need
to maintain a significant physical inventory. You'll
have instant access to your CAD models and design
files, making your production abilities more immediate
and agile. Another very compelling reason to use 3D
printing for your jigs and fixtures is that you don't
have to have a big production run. In fact, it's
better suited to producing lower quantities on demand.

A further advantage is that you can replace obsolete
components, by redesigning them for 3D printing and
digital storage. Retrieving files when needed is fast
and simple, with no heavy lifting required. Parts can
even be produced in the location where they're
actually going to be used, which has a great impact on
logistics.

Once you install a 3D printer and digital inventory on
your production floor, you'll be able to produce parts
in house, and no longer need to move them around
physically. This will not only speed up delivery, but
also reduce your shipping volumes and transportation
costs. This is particularly useful for any business
that operates in extreme or remote locations, such as
battlefields, oil rigs – or space stations!

8. Better Ergonomics
====================

Jigs and fixtures have to be
physically handled by people on the production
floor, so reducing their weight using 3D printing
can make them easier for workers to use. Designing
tools with CAD modelling also means that you can
incorporate organic shapes and contours, providing
operators with greater comfort and improved
accuracy. Jigs and fixtures with ergonomic
functionality help to reduce both downtime and the
number of flawed units, and are safer for operator
health.

The Benefits Summarised These are some of the many
reasons why you should use 3D printing for jigs and
fixtures. They can be summarised as cost,
convenience, speed, safety and adaptability.
